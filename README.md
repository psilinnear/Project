# Project

I need to do analysis on small angle scattering data. I have yet not written a code to do so, but will do it in this project. The scattering data that is uploaded is not good enough to use for my future algorithm. I want make the size symmetric around the middle point, fill in the streaks of the detector and investigate whether it is point symmetry or not.
